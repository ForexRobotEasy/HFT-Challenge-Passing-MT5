## Description

This EA is designed to execute high-frequency trading (HFT) strategies in the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. It monitors price movements and places orders based on predefined conditions.

## How it Works

1. Global variable `ticket` is initialized to 0, representing no pending orders.
2. In the `OnInit()` function, you can add any necessary initialization code.
3. In the `OnDeinit()` function, you can add any necessary deinitialization code.
4. In the `OnTick()` function, the EA checks for pending orders.
    - If `ticket` is 0, it checks if the price crosses certain levels.
        - If the bid price crosses above 1.2000, a buy order is placed using `OrderSend()` function.
        - If the ask price crosses below 1.1900, a sell order is placed using `OrderSend()` function.
    - If `ticket` is not 0, it checks if the pending order has been filled by using `OrderSelect()` function.
        - If the order close time is not 0, indicating the order has been closed, the `ticket` variable is reset to 0.
5. In the `OnStart()` function, you can add any necessary start function code.

Please refer to the official MQL5 documentation for more information on the functions used in this code.
